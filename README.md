# Galaxy-Gravity-Exlaunch

This mod is a rewrite of the old Galaxy-Gravity mod using 
Exlaunch as a basis, as it allows for more fluiditiy.

## Features

Included in this repository is a `romfs` folder, which can be 
used to convert Cascade Kingdom into a WIP version of Good Egg Galaxy from
Super Mario Galaxy. This also includes its own gravity types, which are the following:

- Point Gravity
- Cube Gravity
- Segment Gravity
- Plane Gravity
- Cone Gravity
- Disk Gravity
- Torus Gravity

Each type has been implemented to mimic Super Mario Galaxy as closely
as possible, including things like area parameters. 

If there is no `GravityArea` present, or the actor is not inside it, they will
experience a gravitational pull that is the normal of the triangle of collision
they are standing on.

Not all actors support gravity by default, and so a patch has been added to 
give them such functionality, though most actors do not function as expected.

## Custom Save

Custom save system made by [Amethyst-szs].

Adding custom collectable corrupts saves from the original game, the custom save will save into a custom slots, avoiding all problems.

# Notes

This mod only works on v1.0 of the game, and requires building yourself using cmake.
